      <p>Welcome to part one of my transmedia storytelling senior research project. This two-part project was made with both my honors and digital media & communication theses in mind, hence why the paper reads like a combination of a research paper and a step-by step guide for actually creating a transmedia project. I originally became interested in transmedia storytelling when I began working on my <a href="influencer.html">research project about Lil Miquela</a> and wanted to find a way to explore this phenomenon in a new light. The video to the right is my honors thesis presentation, which covers much of the thesis writing in a more casual tone, created to share my findings with viewers from all backgrounds. The end of this video also features some Q & A from the viewers, answering more questions about what can be considered a transmedia project, implications for the future, and more. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

	  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graphic to the left highlights the core idea of transmedia storytelling. The 'old' version of storytelling (in this case, old does not mean bad or outdated - for some cases, it is the perfect method) follows the traditional style of multimedia or cross media. In this example, there is a movie, a video game, and a book. A traditional route would start with the book, which a movie then adapts, and a video game is made. Although these three entities have the same core story and base, their chain of adaptation is linear, meaning that each new adaptation does nothing to expand upon the narative of the first. Even if these new versions make changes to the original story, by using the same characters and overall plot, they are rewriting rather than expending.&nbsp; <br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second half of the picture, the 'new' version of storytelling is, at its most basic, the transmedia model. In this picture, again, there is a book, a movie, and a game. However, instead of adapting the same story again and again, they build off of one another. While the book may start the narrative, the game and movie expand the pre-established world of the book and utilizes characters, plot points, and more while adding their own unique identity. The chain of influence in this model is not linear - rather, an element of the story can bring more context to past narratives, changing their meaning while building out into the future. This idea, however, is only the beginning - to continue learning about what transmedia storytelling truly is, along with the value it can bring to independent creators, check out my presentation above or read my thesis below.
