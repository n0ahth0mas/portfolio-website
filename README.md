## Overview
</a>

[noahthom.com](http://noahthom.com) is my personal and professional website, featuring my [portfolio](http://noahthom.com/#portfolio), [digital resume](http://noahthom.com/resume.html), [senior thesis project](#hl) and more. While some of this code is expanded upon [templates or snippits](#src), many other sections are completely coded by me.

## HARD LIGHT
</a>

Instead of hashing through each individual section of the website, which would be very repetitive and uninteresting, I thought I would break down my Digital Media & Communication thesis project, [HARD LIGHT](http://noahthom.com/thesisLanding.html). This was a two part project - half of the project was research on the [transmedia model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling) of storytelling and why it was a suitable tool for independent creators, and the other half was a 27-part narrative spread over YouTube and Twitter based off of the previously mentioned research paper. Although this project was meant to be released in real time, the COVID-19 pandemic halted all in-person production of the YouTube videos. Because of this, many videos were unfinished and had to be created using alternate methods with the events happening in theoretical terms. However, this created an interesting problem for me - how was I going to display this story?

While figuring all of this out, I was also in the process of finishing up my [Computer Science Capstone](https://github.com/n0ahth0mas/biomechanics-help) project, which used a flexible layout for each section in a chapter of a class project. The emphasis on flexibility in that project inspired me to create a flexible timeline that would allow me to add and arrange content easily as I completed them. After analyzing a few examples online, I went to work creating my own layout.

The current iteration of the timeline is responsive, allowing the narrative to be viewable on both browser and mobile. To create each card, I utilized a JavaScript function that populates and displays nested divs based on data held in a list of section objects. By doing so, I was able to reduce the amount of code written, edit content quickly, and generate a simple yet effective interactive timeline.

I also wanted to figure out some way to make the website feel impactful and exciting while also not distracting from the core story that I had worked so hard on. To achieve this, I looked at the websites for other film and media projects, and adapted a lot of their structure. This is the reasoning behind the animated header, and interactive character docs.

I feel that this project page represents my flexibility in both creative coding and solutions to seemingly impossible problems. This page can be viewed here: [noahthom.com/thesislanding.html](http://noahthom.com/thesisLanding.html)
