      <h3 class="my-3">Project Description</h3>
      <p>I like to consider this two-part project as my first encounter with&nbsp; transmedia storytelling. I stumbled across Miquela Sosa's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en"> Instagram page</a>&nbsp;in the summer of 2018, when I was researching best practices for a brand's social media and instantly found myself entranced by everything about her and the mysterious company that created her, Brud. When prompted to create a 'bloggable' material about a prevalent trend online for my Online Communication class (University of Puget Sound, Spring 2019) I knew that Miquela Sosa was the answer. In this Vox-style video, I cover topics such as 'the glance,' 'the gaze,' 'the uncanny valley,' and more using language that anyone is able to understand.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

	  <p> This project was so well received by my peers and professor that I felt inspired to expand upon this research for my final project, a research prospectus which asked me to lay the groundwork for a theoretical study on digital influences utilizing peer reviewed research. If all requirements were met - as they were with this project - the paper would theoretically be IRB approvable. At the request of my professor, I submitted this paper to the PNW Communication Studies Undergraduate Research Conference, which unfortunately had to be cancelled. This paper examines digital influencers and asks questions about their appeal based on concepts such as 'the gaze,' and 'the uncanny valley,' and expands upon previous research about digital avatars in movies and video games.&nbsp; </p>

		   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Influencers, defined as individuals “with a significant following on social media who [are] paid by brands to promote their products to said followers” have been a part of Instagram’s platform since its creation in 2010 (Kádeková &amp; Holienčinová, 2018, Instagram, n.d.). Also known as micro-celebrities, influencers have found their own niches, gotten stoppered, and become profitable. A new wave of these micro-celebrities have risen on Instagram in the recent years. Known as virtual influencers, these computer generated (CG) characters have simultaneously broken the mold for influencers, as well as reinforced standards of westernized beauty and popularity.
	Some of today’s most prominent virtual influencers are Miquela Sosa (known by her Instagram handle, @lilmiquela, figure 1), Shudu (@shudu.gram, figure 2), and recently, Colonel Sanders, Kentucky Friend Chicken’s revamped CG influencer of their own, complete with brand deals (@kfc, figure 3). These influencers have achieved a number of feats. Lil Miquela was voted as one of TIME magazine’s top 25 most influential people in the internet, has a successful music career, her own clothing line, over 1.5 million followers, and modeling deals (Time Staff, 2018). Miquela (and her creator team, Brud) were recently ‘sponsored’ by YouTube to attend Coachellafest in April 2019, where she interviewed artists about their music and posted these interviews on her social media platform. Shudu, one of the other primary virtual influencers this study focuses on, belongs to The Diigitals, a marketing firm who call themselves “The world’s first all digital modeling agency” (The Diigitals, n.d.). Currently, they have a roster of six models, one of which is an alien. </p> -->
